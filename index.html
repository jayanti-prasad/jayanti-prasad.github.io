Almost twenty years ago, I created my first web page with Yahoo Geo Cities. I fell in love with the process of creating a web page and deploying it. There was no social media at the time, and Orkut came a bit later. I used to visit the web pages of many scientists, and most of them were very primitive. Even web pages of well-known organizations were not fancy. I wrote my own HTML/CSS and created framed side/top bars, embedded images, and even calendars. A list of useful resources was also an integral part of the webpage. Later, my host institute provided me and other members with dedicated webspace, and any content we put in our public_html folder would go live the next day!

I  am interested in science, technology, and many other subjects, including history and philosophy. Here, you will find more about me, my passions, and my work! Use the navigation bar on top to browse different pages.
