Life, Computers, and the Universe – these three systems have captured my interest. One might wonder what commonalities exist among them and how they relate to each other. Let me first delve into the connection between computers and the universe.
</p>

<p>
  Two decades ago, in the early 2000s, when I commenced my Ph.D. thesis in cosmology, the study of the origin and evolution of the universe, I discovered the vastness of the cosmos in terms of time and space. Human lifetimes, in comparison, are too brief to observe significant changes in the universe. Furthermore, I realized that mathematical equations sometimes become too complex for analytical solutions. In both scenarios, computers proved invaluable. They enable us to simulate systems and processes as immense as clusters of galaxies and stars and solve intricate equations, such as Einstein's General Relativity equation, numerically. My Ph.D. work predominantly involved computational methods, and you can explore my publications on my Google Scholar page. This realization led me to understand that, in addition to theory, observations, and experiments, numerical simulations play a crucial role in advancing science. Since then, computers and the universe have occupied a substantial portion of my cognitive space.

The case of life takes a different turn. From Schrödinger to Freeman Dyson, numerous physicists have shown a keen interest in living systems. Although Schrödinger's "What is Life?" faced criticism, with claims that the original content was incorrect and the correct ideas weren't his contributions, Dyson's ideas stand out. Life, as we know it, comprises two types of systems: one for managing energy (mostly proteins made of amino acids) and another for managing information (DNA molecules made of nucleic acids). The origin of both amino acids and nucleic acids is highly improbable, and considering their simultaneous emergence makes the probability of life as we know it very low. However, if we consider the independent development of these abilities at different times, the likelihood of life's origin increases slightly. Life, in contrast to the second law of thermodynamics, is a system where disorder or entropy doesn't unilaterally increase with time. For physicists and computer scientists, wherever there's an issue with information, interest naturally follows, making life a natural playground.

At the intersection of life, information, intelligence, and consciousness, there is a substantial area of active research, often centered around human beings. It's crucial to note that building a theory or model from a single example might not always be a fruitful approach. Take the case of powered flight – progress only truly began when people focused on the general principles of aviation instead of merely copying birds. The same might hold true for life, intelligence, and consciousness. If we take life on Earth, human intelligence, and human consciousness as templates, we might miss out on broader principles. The ultimate goal should be to understand principles that can cover a much wider array of examples than we currently know.
</p>

<p>
Now, turning to the case of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – defined as intelligence superior to human intelligence in every aspect – it poses a significant challenge. We still struggle to quantify overall human intelligence. For instance, humans are notably more adept learners than artificial intelligence systems in terms of the training they require.
