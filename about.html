<p>
Born and brought up in the small village of Rudraprayag district in Uttarakhand, I completed my Masters in Physics (with specialization in Electronics & Communication) from HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar Garhwal (Uttarakhand) in 1998. For a brief period, I was a physics teacher for class XI & XII at SGRR Public School, Srinagar Garhwal, and I also obtained a Diploma in Education in 2000. After clearing national level tests such as JEST and CSIR-UGC (NET), I moved to Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad (now Prayagraj) in 2001, to pursue my Ph.D. in Astrophysics. You can find more about the work I have done there on the research page.
</p>
<p>
After compleating my Ph.D under the supervision of Prof. J. S. Bagla, In 2008, I moved to National Center for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR) for my first postdoc with Prof. Jayaram Chengalur (now director of TIFR Mumbai). I mainly worked on computational tasks and was involved in data processing pipelines of GMRT data.
</p>
<p>
Later in 2010, I joined the Inter-University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics (IUCAA) as a postdoctoral fellow, working with Prof. Tarun Souradeep (now director of Raman Research Institute, Bangalore). I stayed at IUCAA for almost 8 years, working in various capacities, including being a Principal Investigator of my own project funded by the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India. During my time at IUCAA, I joined the LIGO Scientific Collaboration in 2012 and remained a member until 2018, when I left IUCAA. I made multiple visits to other LIGO labs and observatories in the USA and helped set up a 200 TF LIGO Data Grid Cluster at IUCAA. During this period, I became heavily involved in Big Data technologies and high-performance and grid computing. Our work at IUCAA with LIGO was well appreciated, and we were also part of the team that made the first discovery of the black hole merger event in 2015, receiving many awards and co-authoring 100+ publications with LIGO.
</p>
<p>
Since 2018, I have been working in the IT industry. Firstly, I worked with Accelere (now Embold) Technologies as a data scientist, and then switched to DISYS India (Chennai) as a data scientist in 2020.
