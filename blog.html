<br>

<p>
  There have been three great debates in the last 100 years (there may be more, but I am aware of three) that have had a huge impact on the ideas that have been
  developed over time. Note that some of the debates were not exactly in the form of a debate but some kind of dialouge between two opposing camps. 
</p>
<p>
The first debate took place between Harlow Shapley, a young ambitious rising star in astronomy who specialized in the properties of stars in binary systems of globular clusters, and Heber D. Curtis, a well-respected established authority on the properties of spiral nebulae known for his conservative approach and frequent skepticism of new theories, in April 1920 at the Natural History Museum in Washington, DC. Curtis believed that the nebulae (some fuzzy objects observed in the night sky) were actually other galaxies, and that the universe is made up of far more galaxies than just our Milky Way. Shapley opposed the idea and proposed that these nebulae were just part of our own galaxy. The debate was finally settled after Edwin Hubble observed many galaxies and also discovered the expansion of the universe.
</p>    

<p>
The second debate which is as big as the first one, if not bigger than first, did take place between Albert Einstein & Niels Bohr.
